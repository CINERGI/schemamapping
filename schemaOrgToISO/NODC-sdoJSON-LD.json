	"description": "NODC Accession 0106340 includes profile, undulating profile, biological, chemical and physical data collected aboard the ENDEAVOR during cruises EN321 and EN325 in the North Atlantic Ocean from 1999-03-30 to 1999-06-27. These data include CHLOROPHYLL A, SALINITY, HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE, DISSOLVED OXYGEN, TEMPERATURE and SIGMA-T. The instruments used to collect these data include Undulating towed profiler and CTD. These data were collected by Dian J. Gifford and Karen Wishner of University of Rhode Island as part of GB. The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) submitted these data to NODC on 2013-04-25.The following is the text of the abstract provided by BCO-DMO:SCANFISH CTD Data Endeavor Cruises 321 and 325PI Notes: The Scanfish is a towed undulating vehicle carrying a CTD and several other sensors and was utilized on Endeavor Cruises 321 and 325 to Georges Bank. The scanfish is towed along various transacts to map the hydrographic properties of a survey area. During each cruise a number of tows were carried out, and the data are organized by tow. The SeaBird 911plus CTD records data at 24 Hz. It has been processed following the procedures outlined by O'Malley, et al (1998) and subsequently averaged to 1 Hz. REFERENCEO'Malley, R., J. A.
